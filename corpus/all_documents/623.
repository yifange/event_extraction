Lucy,

Here is a new file for 12/15.




For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:

 #23 & #24 did not pay.  Just late or moving?

 #25 & #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08.  What is the deal?

 #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?


Please email the answers.

Phillip
