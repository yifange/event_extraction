Johnnie,

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
