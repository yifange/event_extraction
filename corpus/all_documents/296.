Will,


Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

Phillip
