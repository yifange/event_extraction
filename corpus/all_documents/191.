Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Phillip
