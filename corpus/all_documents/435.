Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.
