Lucy,

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with 
the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I 
mean.

Talk to you later,

Phillip
