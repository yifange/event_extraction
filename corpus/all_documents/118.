Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?
Brenda
