There are a number of excellent sites for radiant heating, including the
magazine fine homebuilding June-July 1992 issue: the Radiant Panel
Association;  ASHRAE  Chapter 6;   Radiantec-Radiant heating system from
Radiantec;  the following web site:  http://www.twapanels.ca/heating
index.html

The above is a good start, and each of the sites have a number of good
links.  Let me know how you make out in your search.
