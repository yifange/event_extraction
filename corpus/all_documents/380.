Phillip,

I got this request.  On the gas side, I think Kean/Lay need an update to a 
table you prepared for me a few months ago, which I've attached..  Can you 
oblige?  Thanks,

Alan Comnes

Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the "stupid regulatory/legislative decisions" since the beginning of the 
year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's "Ken Lay Tour" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?
