Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?
