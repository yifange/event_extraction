Frank,

Did you receive the information about the San Marcos apartments.  I have left 
several messages at your office to follow up.  You mentioned that your plate 
was fairly full.  Are you too busy to look at this project?  As I mentioned I 
would be interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding 
board for the key issues.  

Please email or call.
