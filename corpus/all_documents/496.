George,

I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between 
March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.

Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your 
time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The 
items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just 
clarification of what was in a number.  

Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow 
morning.  

Phillip
