$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it 
take him?  I think $100 should be enough. 

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want 
your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview
to see what your print out will look like before you print.

The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve 
adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high
for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

Glad to hear about the good deposit for this week.  Great job on February.
