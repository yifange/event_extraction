Jeff,

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday. 


Phillip
