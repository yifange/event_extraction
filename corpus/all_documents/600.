Questions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?


 A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.
