Mike--

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.
