Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.
