George,

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

PS.  Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home in 
Kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.  You 
should try their website or call the station to get the full story.  It would 
makes a good case for breathable walls.
