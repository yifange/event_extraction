Christy,

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in 
California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.  

Phillip

Subject: Talking points about California Gas market

Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.
