Lucy,

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

Phillip
