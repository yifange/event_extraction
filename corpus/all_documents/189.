Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.
