Kay & Neal,

Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  

The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.  She is a very happy baby 
as long as she is being held.

It sounds like your house is coming along fast.  I think my folks are ready 
to start building.  

We will probably visit in late June or July.  May is busy.  We are taking the 
kids to Disney for their birthdays.

Good luck on the house.

Keith
