Don,

I was out last week.  Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to 
Mark Whitt in Denver.  

Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.

Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta's desk 
or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES.  I don't understand 
why your people don't contact the desk directly.

Phillip
