Naomi,

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Call me with questions.(x37041)
