Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.  

Phillip
