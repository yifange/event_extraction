I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.   
 What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
 Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.

Thanks,

Phillip
