Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.  

Keep Pedalling - Lee
