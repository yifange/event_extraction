Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin
