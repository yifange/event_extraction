Daryl,

Here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps.  This 
file was prepared by the builder/developer.


The architect that has begun to work on the project is Kipp Flores.  They are 
in Austin.

Thank you for your time this evening.  Your comments were very helpful.  I 
appreciate you and Greg taking a look at this project.
