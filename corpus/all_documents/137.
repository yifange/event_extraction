  9/8  9/7  diff

Socal  36,600  37,200  -600

NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250

San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500


The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the 
transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan 
and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and 
sold 800 Socal.
