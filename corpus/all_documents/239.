Dear Phillip,

Frogger is leaving shockwave.com soon...

Save it to your Shockmachine now! 

Every frog has his day - games, too. Frogger had a great run as an 
arcade classic, but it is leaving the shockwave.com pond soon. The 
good news is that you can download it to your Shockmachine and 
own it forever! 

Don't know about Shockmachine? You can download Shockmachine for free 
and save all of your downloadable favorites to play off-line, 
full-screen, whenever you want. 

Download Frogger by noon, PST on June 30th, while it's still on 
the site!
