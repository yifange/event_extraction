George & Larry,


 If possible,  I would like to get together in Columbus as Larry suggested.  
Thursday afternoon is the only day that really works for me.  
Let me know if that would work for you.  I was thinking around 2  or 2:30 pm.

I will try to email you any questions I have from the latest proforma 
tomorrow.


Phillip
