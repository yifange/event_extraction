Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.
