Gentlemen,

 I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure 
and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing, 
I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have 
sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information 
on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone 
(713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.

 I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I 
hope to pull that together this afternoon.

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He 
was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the 
bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss 
these procedures in advance.

 Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.

Phillip
