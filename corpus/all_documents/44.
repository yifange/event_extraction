Can you please review the following systems presented in this spreadsheet for 
your group and let us know if you in fact use all these systems.  The West 
Gas includes West Gas Trading, West Gas Originations, and the Denver piece 
combined.  Also, we need for you to give us the breakout for the applicable 
groups.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
