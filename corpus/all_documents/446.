Reagan,

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.
