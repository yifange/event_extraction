Lucy,

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.  
  
  The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
  

 I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me 
tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and 
applications.  

Phillip
