Jeanie,

Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into 
part time.  Nice confidentiality.  Since I have already gotten the grief, it 
would be nice to get some useful information.  What did you find out about 
part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals?  My interest is for 2002.

Phillip
