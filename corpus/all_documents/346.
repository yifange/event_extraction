plant)

project

Lot's

minds

> Labor for Stamping Crew $2500.00
> Davis Color Stain 4lbs per yd x 100 yds x $18 lb $7200.00

> These are above and beyond the cost of the concrete.

> Actual Result: Took a truck and trailer to Mexico and handpicked Sautillo
tiles

per yd
> mix color, added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in the
porch

> Tiles and Transportation $3000.00
> Labor, mastic and beer. tile setting (did it myself) $1400.00
