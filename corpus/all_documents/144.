Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Phillip
