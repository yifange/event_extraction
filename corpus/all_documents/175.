Open the "utility" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it 
is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel.
