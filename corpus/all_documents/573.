Lucy,

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.



Phillip
