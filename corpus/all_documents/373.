Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include 
some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is 
working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA 
financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to 
you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still 
attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Phillip
