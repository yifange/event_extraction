John,

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the "assume it is messed up" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

Phillip
