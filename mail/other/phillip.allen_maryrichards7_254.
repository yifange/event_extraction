Mary,

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 
or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.  
12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you 
could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound 
fair?  We can apply it to the loan.

Phillip
