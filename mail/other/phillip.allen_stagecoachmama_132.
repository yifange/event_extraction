Lucy,


You wrote fewer checks this month.  Spent more money on Materials and less on 
Labor.


   June  July  August

Total Materials  2929  4085  4801

Services  53  581  464

Labor   3187  3428  2770






Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):

1.  Check 1406  Walmart    Description and unit?

2.  Check 1410  Crumps     Detail description and unit?

3.  Check 1411  Lucy      What is this?

4.  Check 1415  Papes      Detail description and units?

5.  Checks 1416, 1417, and 1425  Why overtime?

6.  Check 1428    Ralph's   What unit?

7.  Check 1438    Walmart?    Description and unit?  


Try and pull together the support for these items and get back to me.
